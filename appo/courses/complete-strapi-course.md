  The **definitive course to learn Strapi v4** from the basics to advanced usage




  **Why Strapi and why this course?**


  This course is perfect for anyone that wants to add Strapi to their developer toolbox, being it the **most popular headless CMS** in the market (and still growing!), which combines **top-level out-of-the-box features** with **strong flexibility and extensibility**.


  **Build and deploy a complete Strapi app, plus a complete plugin!**


  In this course I will drive you from the very basic concepts to building, customizing and deploying a **complete Strapi application**.


  The application we'll be creating includes features built by **extending the Strapi core** via custom logic (routes, controllers, GraphQL resolvers, etc.). Furthermore, in this course you'll be developing a **complete plugin** (admin + server code), that is ready to be published on the Strapi Market (and in fact you will find it there now!).


  Let me say that the **Strapi Plugin section** is a course in the course, and it will give you the skills to propose Strapi plugins to customers, both through the newborn Strapi market (that has high growth potential) and directly.


  **Course topics list**


  Here are the main topics you will be learning:


  * Working with content: **content types, fields, relations, components, dynamic zones**

  * **Authorization & authentication** system

  * Working with the **REST API**

  * Working with the **GraphQL API**

  * Extending Strapi core: **custom routes, controllers**, services, policies, middleware

  * **Extending the GraphQL plugin**

  * **Customizing the Admin Panel**

  * Creating a **complete plugin** (server and admin included), ready for the Strapi marketplace

  * **Deploying Strapi** in production


  **What you'll be able to do afterwards**


  By the end of this course, you will feel empowered as you'll master a framework that **dramatically speeds up time to market** in developing **production-ready backend applications**, while not sacrificing **extensibility** to adapt it to endless use cases and business requirements!\
